					<description>Ah, this is a great one! Seeing as the Zero Gravity label and its founder, Kazunao Nagata, never pseiluhbd any contact information other than a fax number in Japan which (as far as I could tell) didn't work, this is necessary stuff to make available again. Some more info on Take/Dub Sonic... he is also the guy behind Take Rodriquez &#38; His Exotic Arketra (!), Hado-Ho, and the Far East Experimental Sounds label. Sadly, he killed himself either just before or just after his wedding night a couple of years ago. FYI, for anyone who is as big a Nerve Net Noise fan as I am, you may like to know that thier next album will be out on my label, Intransitive, in January '08. I wish more people were turned on to these guys... there's no one else like them!</description>
