					<description>First, let me say that I really enjoy your blog.  It is a vblaaule source of thoughtful musings on an underappreciated corner of the music world, and the joy you find in the music shines through in your writing.Second, I think Rainey is a treasure.  I first learned of him through his work with Tim Berne and Mark Helias.  His playing with Berne, especially, is just sublime.  I imagine a fast, rocky river--jostling and flipping leaves, splashing stones, fluidly slipping past obstacles, sometimes silently, sometimes noisily, but always moving to an incessant yet varying natural rhythm.  I am occasionally asked by friends with less unconventional tastes in music (friends who consider someone like Berne to be producing random noise) why I like the music I do.  But to me the answer is simply that it is beautiful.  It may not have an easy-to-see pattern, or perhaps any repeated elements to grasp onto.  But this should not be a barrier.  If we can find beauty in nature's chaos--in the patter of rain or the fork of a lightning bolt or a cliff wall or a stand of trees--it isn't that hard to find beauty in "free" or "free-er" kinds of jazz.  To me, Rainey fits this picture quite well--he is the river.</description>
